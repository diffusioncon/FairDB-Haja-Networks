# How to use
This project is still in the prototyping stage, please open the index.html in this root directory to view the home page.

# FairDB Serverside
This nodejs program will run on a server hosted by us, and will provide an interface to the OrbitDB using a REST API. When a user submits their information to the REST API, we cryptographically encrypt the data using PGP techniques so that the data within the OrbitDB is encrypted to a millitary grade.

# FairDB OrbitDB Node
This project will run on arduino/MCU electronics (low power), and will host the database content using IPFS and OrbitDB.
